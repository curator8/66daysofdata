# 66daysofdata
Personal accounts of my 66 day journey on learning about data science. 

# day 1 

So this is day 1 of 66 days of my data journey, at the moment, I am following this Github's page Data Analyst recommend learning path (https://lnkd.in/drJYYgi) to go over some the basic syntax and packages on python, you can view my code here https://lnkd.in/dgPnfSK. The course I am following was created by Maxwell Armi (https://lnkd.in/diVsFH8)

# day 2
yeah it's technically day 3, but I haven't fallen asleep yet so I figured I report what I learned throughout the day (for day 2). I also decided to include some stuff I am learning from my statistics tutoring position, applied statistical analysis, and algorithms and data structure class since they're relevant to my Data Science journey. 

At the moment I am learning about Multiple linear Regression, we just recently started the chapter on confounding between predictor variables and how it affects the overall analysis. In my tutoring session, I had to explain various probability rules like general addition rule versus addition rule or concepts like disjoint events versus independent events (to be honest they still confuse me :D). In my data structures and algorithms class, I've been working in a team setting to work on a tweet program, where we can add, edit, like, and print tweets on the console (so far it's been fun and challenging). 

In terms of python, I learned for loop syntax through Maxwell Armi's implementation of a selection sort algorithm using 2 for loops. To be honest, I definitely see the appeal of learning python as a first language, since it's very clear on what's what. ANYWAYS, that's all for today, thanks for reading!

# day 3
I was catching up on some assignments last night so I didn't get a chance to post on my day 3 progress. I'm still on Maxwell Armi's python course, the good news is I am about half way through. I think it helps that I have a programming background which allows me to skim over some topics.

I mainly reviewed a lot of statistics yesterday. I read some more on how we interpret cofounding and the coefficient of determination when applying multiple linear regression in context of the given question and data. That being said, my applied statistical analysis teacher recently assigned a project to us to apply some of the concepts we learned so far which should be fun :).

I also brushed up on some previous concept like binomial distribution (and function) to help a fellow student with some of the intuition behind it and how to solve different sorts problems associated with it. But, that's all for today, thanks for reading!

# day 4 
#66daysofdata: day 4: Good morning everyone, yesterday wasn't as productive as a I hoped, since I had to catch up on some discrete math and statistics HW. But since those two classes are relevant to the whole data journey, talking about them counts!

In discrete math, we're learning about proofs. I definitely see all the hype (not really) behind them. To do a proof requires a strict style of thinking, and in a computer scientist case, a strict style of thinking on the nature of countable items. I am little foggy on the concepts, but I have to pretty much prove a theorem, such as "all numbers are integers are positive" (or there is a number that is positive), by presenting hypotheses that eventually leads to the conclusion. So far, I learned there are different styles of arguments, but I need more time to practice them first. 

In Statistics, I continued refining my understanding on cofounding and interaction between predictor variables and determining whether by adding an extra predictor variable in the analysis affects the original X-Y relationship. I am guessing analyzing cofounding is a nice numerical measure on the effects on adding a variable, that being said, I have to be careful not to confuse it with correlation or the coefficient of determination.
