# 66daysofdata
Personal accounts of my 66 day journey on learning about data science. 

# day 1 

So this is day 1 of 66 days of my data journey, at the moment, I am following this Github's page Data Analyst recommend learning path (https://lnkd.in/drJYYgi) to go over some the basic syntax and packages on python, you can view my code here https://lnkd.in/dgPnfSK. The course I am following was created by Maxwell Armi (https://lnkd.in/diVsFH8)

# day 2
yeah it's technically day 3, but I haven't fallen asleep yet so I figured I report what I learned throughout the day (for day 2). I also decided to include some stuff I am learning from my statistics tutoring position, applied statistical analysis, and algorithms and data structure class since they're relevant to my Data Science journey. 

At the moment I am learning about Multiple linear Regression, we just recently started the chapter on confounding between predictor variables and how it affects the overall analysis. In my tutoring session, I had to explain various probability rules like general addition rule versus addition rule or concepts like disjoint events versus independent events (to be honest they still confuse me :D). In my data structures and algorithms class, I've been working in a team setting to work on a tweet program, where we can add, edit, like, and print tweets on the console (so far it's been fun and challenging). 

In terms of python, I learned for loop syntax through Maxwell Armi's implementation of a selection sort algorithm using 2 for loops. To be honest, I definitely see the appeal of learning python as a first language, since it's very clear on what's what. ANYWAYS, that's all for today, thanks for reading!
